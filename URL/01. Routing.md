# Routing

### The Default Route Files

- Routes are defined in your route files located in the routes directory.
- Automatically loaded by Laravel using the configuration specified in your application's bootstrap/app.php file.
- The routes/web.php file defines routes that are for web interface. These routes are assigned the web middleware group, which provides features like session state and CSRF protection.

### API Routes

- For stateless API, enable API routing using the `install:api` artisan command
- install:api command creates the routes/api.php file:
- The install:api command installs Laravel Sanctum, which provides a robust, yet simple API token authentication guard which can be used to authenticate third-party API consumers, SPAs, or mobile applications.
- The routes in routes/api.php are stateless and are assigned to the api middleware group.

Additionally, the /api URI prefix is automatically applied to these routes, so you do not need to manually apply it to every route in the file. You may change the prefix by modifying your application's bootstrap/app.php file:

```php
->withRouting(
    api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php',
    apiPrefix: 'api/admin',
    // ...
)
```

### Available Router Methods

```php
Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);
```

`match` responds to multiple HTTP verbs. `any` responds to all HTTP verbs.

```php
Route::match(['get', 'post'], '/', function () {
    // ...
});

Route::any('/', function () {
    // ...
});
```

> When defining multiple routes that share the same URI, routes using the get, post, put, patch, delete, and options methods should be defined before routes using the any, match, and redirect methods. This ensures the incoming request is matched with the correct route.

- Type hinted dependencies will automatically be injected into the callback
- Type-hint the Illuminate\Http\Request class to have the current HTTP request injected into your route callback:

### CSRF Protection

 Any HTML forms pointing to POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE routes that are defined in the web routes file should include a CSRF token field. Otherwise, the request will be rejected

```html
<form method="POST" action="/profile">
    @csrf
    ...
</form>
```

### Redirect Routes

By default, Route::redirect returns a 302 status code.

```php
Route::redirect('/here', '/there');
```

For permanant redirects

```php
Route::redirect('/here', '/there', 301);

Route::permanentRedirect('/here', '/there');
```

> When using route parameters in redirect routes, the following parameters are reserved by Laravel and cannot be used: destination and status.


### View Routes

```php
Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome');

Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome', ['name' => 'Taylor']);
```

> When using route parameters in view routes, the following parameters cannot be used: view, data, status, and headers.

### Listing Your Routes

```bash
php artisan route:list

# Display route middleware
php artisan route:list -v

# Expand middleware groups
php artisan route:list -vv

# Begins with given URI
php artisan route:list --path=api

# Hide routes defined by third party packages
php artisan route:list --except-vendor

# Show only routes defined by third party packages
php artisan route:list --only-vendor
```

### Routing Customization

Application's routes are configured and loaded by the bootstrap/app.php file:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )->create();
```

To define an entirely new file to contain a subset of your application's routes you may provide a `then` closure to the withRouting method.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

->withRouting(
    web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
    commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
    health: '/up',
    then: function () {
        Route::middleware('api')
            ->prefix('webhooks')
            ->name('webhooks.')
            ->group(base_path('routes/webhooks.php'));
    },
)
```

Complete control over route registration by providing a `using` closure to the withRouting method. No HTTP routes will be registered by the framework and you are responsible for manually registering all routes.

```php
<?php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

->withRouting(
    commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
    using: function () {
        Route::middleware('api')
            ->prefix('api')
            ->group(base_path('routes/api.php'));

        Route::middleware('web')
            ->group(base_path('routes/web.php'));
    },
)
```

## Route Parameters

### Required Parameters

Capture segments of the URI within your route:

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $id) {
    return 'User '.$id;
});
```

- Always encased within {} braces and should consist of alphabetic characters
- Underscores (_) are also acceptable
- Injected into route callbacks / controllers based on their order - the names of the arguments do not matter

You should list your route parameters after your dependencies:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/user/{id}', function (Request $request, string $id) {
    return 'User '.$id;
});
```

To make route parameter optional place `?` mark after the parameter name.

```php
Route::get('/user/{name?}', function (?string $name = null) {
    return $name;
});

Route::get('/user/{name?}', function (?string $name = 'John') {
    return $name;
});
```

### Regular Expression Constraints

The where method accepts the name of the parameter and a regular expression defining how the parameter should be constrained:

```php
Route::get('/user/{name}', function (string $name) {
    // ...
})->where('name', '[A-Za-z]+');

Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $id) {
    // ...
})->where('id', '[0-9]+');

Route::get('/user/{id}/{name}', function (string $id, string $name) {
    // ...
})->where(['id' => '[0-9]+', 'name' => '[a-z]+']);
```

Commonly used regular expression patterns have helper methods

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}/{name}', function (string $id, string $name) {
    // ...
})->whereNumber('id')->whereAlpha('name');

Route::get('/user/{name}', function (string $name) {
    // ...
})->whereAlphaNumeric('name');

Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $id) {
    // ...
})->whereUuid('id');

Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $id) {
    // ...
})->whereUlid('id');

Route::get('/category/{category}', function (string $category) {
    // ...
})->whereIn('category', ['movie', 'song', 'painting']);

Route::get('/category/{category}', function (string $category) {
    // ...
})->whereIn('category', CategoryEnum::cases());
```

If the incoming request does not match the route pattern constraints, a 404 HTTP response will be returned.

### Global Constraints

Use `pattern` method to always be constrained by a given regular expression. Define these patterns in the boot method of `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` class.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Route::pattern('id', '[0-9]+');
}
```

Once the pattern has been defined, it is automatically applied to all routes using that parameter name:

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $id) {
    // Only executed if {id} is numeric...
});
```

### Encoded Forward Slashes

The Laravel routing component allows all characters except / to be present within route parameter values. You must explicitly allow / to be part of your placeholder using a where condition regular expression:

```php
Route::get('/search/{search}', function (string $search) {
    return $search;
})->where('search', '.*');
```

> Encoded forward slashes are only supported within the last route segment.

### Named Routes

Named routes allow the convenient generation of URLs or redirects for specific routes.

```php
Route::get('/user/profile', function () {
    // ...
})->name('profile');
```

> Route names should always be unique.


### Generating URLs to Named Routes

```php
// Generating URLs...
$url = route('profile');

// Generating Redirects...
return redirect()->route('profile');

return to_route('profile');
```

Route parameters can be passed as second argument to the route function.

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}/profile', function (string $id) {
    // ...
})->name('profile');

$url = route('profile', ['id' => 1]);
```

Additional parameters in the array will automatically be added to the generated URL's query string:

```php
$url = route('profile', ['id' => 1, 'photos' => 'yes']);

// /user/1/profile?photos=yes
```

> Sometimes, you may wish to specify request-wide default values for URL parameters, such as the current locale. To accomplish this, you may use the `URL::defaults` method.

### Inspecting the Current Route

```php
if ($request->route()->named('profile')) {
        // ...
}
```

## Route Groups

Route groups allow you to share route attributes, such as middleware, across a large number of routes without needing to define those attributes on each individual route.

Nested groups attempt to intelligently "merge" attributes with their parent group. Middleware and where conditions are merged while names and prefixes are appended. Namespace delimiters and slashes in URI prefixes are automatically added where appropriate.


Assign middleware to all routes within a group. Middleware are executed in the order they are listed in the array:

```php
Route::middleware(['first', 'second'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', function () {
        // Uses first & second middleware...
    });

    Route::get('/user/profile', function () {
        // Uses first & second middleware...
    });
});
```

If all routes utilize the same controller

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\OrderController;

Route::controller(OrderController::class)->group(function () {
    // only need to provide the controller method
    Route::get('/orders/{id}', 'show');
    Route::post('/orders', 'store');
});
```

Route groups may also be used to handle subdomain routing. Subdomains may be assigned route parameters just like route URIs, allowing you to capture a portion of the subdomain for usage in your route or controller. The subdomain may be specified by calling the domain method before defining the group:

```php
Route::domain('{account}.example.com')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $account, string $id) {
        // ...
    });
});
```

> In order to ensure your subdomain routes are reachable, you should register subdomain routes before registering root domain routes. This will prevent root domain routes from overwriting subdomain routes which have the same URI path


Prefix all route URIs within the group with admin:

```php
Route::prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users', function () {
        // Matches The "/admin/users" URL
    });
});
```

The name method may be used to prefix each route name in the group with a given string.

```php
Route::name('admin.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users', function () {
        // Route assigned name "admin.users"...
    })->name('users');
});
```

## Route Model Binding

Route model binding automatically injects the model instances directly into your routes.

### Implicit Binding

Implicitly binds when type-hinted variable names match a route segment name.

```php
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
    return $user->email;
});
```

Instruct the implicit binding to retrieve soft delete models by chaining the `withTrashed` method onto your route's definition.

```php
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
    return $user->email;
})->withTrashed();
```

Customizing the Key

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Route::get('/posts/{post:slug}', function (Post $post) {
    return $post;
});
```

To always use a database column other than id, override the `getRouteKeyName` method on the Eloquent model.

```php
/**
 * Get the route key for the model.
 */
public function getRouteKeyName(): string
{
    return 'slug';
}
```

### Custom Keys and Scoping

When using a `custom keyed implicit binding` as a nested route parameter, Laravel will automatically scope the query to retrieve the nested model by its parent using conventions to guess the relationship name on the parent. In this case, it will be assumed that the User model has a relationship named posts (the plural form of the route parameter name) which can be used to retrieve the Post model.


```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post:slug}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $post;
});
```

If you wish, you may instruct Laravel to scope "child" bindings even when a custom key is not provided. To do so, you may invoke the scopeBindings method when defining your route

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $post;
})->scopeBindings();
```

Or, you may instruct an entire group of route definitions to use scoped bindings:

```php
Route::scopeBindings()->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
        return $post;
    });
});
```

Similarly, you may explicitly instruct Laravel to not scope bindings by invoking the `withoutScopedBindings` method:

```php
Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post:slug}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $post;
})->withoutScopedBindings();
```


### Customizing Missing Model Behavior

The missing method accepts a closure that will be invoked if an implicitly bound model cannot be found so you can change the customize the default behavior (404 http response).

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\LocationsController;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect;

Route::get('/locations/{location:slug}', [LocationsController::class, 'show'])
        ->name('locations.view')
        ->missing(function (Request $request) {
            return Redirect::route('locations.index');
        });
```

### Implicit Enum Binding

Type-hint a backed Enum on your route definition and Laravel will only invoke the route if that route segment corresponds to a valid Enum value.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Enums;

enum Category: string
{
    case Fruits = 'fruits';
    case People = 'people';
}
```

You may define a route that will only be invoked if the {category} route segment is fruits or people. Otherwise, Laravel will return a 404 HTTP response:

```php
use App\Enums\Category;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/categories/{category}', function (Category $category) {
    return $category->value;
});
```

### Explicit Binding

To explicitly define how route parameters correspond to models use the router's model method to specify the class for a given parameter.

You should define your explicit model bindings at the beginning of the boot method of your AppServiceProvider class:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Route::model('user', User::class);
}
```

Next, define a route that contains a {user} parameter:

```php
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
    // ...
});
```

### Customizing the Resolution Logic

Route::bind method will receive the value of the URI segment and should return the instance of the class. Provide in `boot` method of your application's `AppServiceProvider`.

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Route::bind('user', function (string $value) {
        return User::where('name', $value)->firstOrFail();
    });
}
```

Alternatively, you may override the `resolveRouteBinding` method on your Eloquent model.

```php
/**
 * Retrieve the model for a bound value.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $value
 * @param  string|null  $field
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null
 */
public function resolveRouteBinding($value, $field = null)
{
    return $this->where('name', $value)->firstOrFail();
}
```

If a route is utilizing implicit binding scoping, the `resolveChildRouteBinding` method will be used to resolve the child binding of the parent model:

```php
/**
 * Retrieve the child model for a bound value.
 *
 * @param  string  $childType
 * @param  mixed  $value
 * @param  string|null  $field
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null
 */
public function resolveChildRouteBinding($childType, $value, $field)
{
    return parent::resolveChildRouteBinding($childType, $value, $field);
}
```

### Fallback Routes

Typically, unhandled requests will automatically render a "404" page via your application's exception handler. However, since you would typically define the fallback route within your routes/web.php file, all middleware in the web middleware group will apply to the route. You are free to add additional middleware to this route as needed:

```php
Route::fallback(function () {
    // ...
});
```

> The fallback route should always be the last route registered by your application.


## Form Method Spoofing

HTML forms do not support PUT, PATCH, or DELETE actions. So, when defining PUT, PATCH, or DELETE routes that are called from an HTML form, you will need to add a hidden _method field to the form. The value sent with the _method field will be used as the HTTP request method:

```html
<form action="/example" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">
    <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">
</form>
```

For convenience, you may use the @method Blade directive to generate the _method input field:

```html
<form action="/example" method="POST">
    @method('PUT')
    @csrf
</form>
```


## Accessing the Current Route

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

$route = Route::current(); // Illuminate\Routing\Route
$name = Route::currentRouteName(); // string
$action = Route::currentRouteAction(); // string
```

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Laravel can automatically respond to CORS OPTIONS HTTP requests with values that you configure. The OPTIONS requests will automatically be handled by the HandleCors middleware that is automatically included in your application's global middleware stack.

Sometimes, you may need to customize the CORS configuration values for your application. You may do so by publishing the cors configuration file using the config:publish Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan config:publish cors
```

This command will place a `cors.php` configuration file within your application's `config` directory.


## Route Caching

To generate a route cache, execute the route:cache Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan route:cache
```

After running this command, your cached routes file will be loaded on every request. Remember, if you add any new routes you will need to generate a fresh route cache. Because of this, you should only run the route:cache command during your project's deployment

You may use the route:clear command to clear the route cache:

```bash
php artisan route:clear
```
