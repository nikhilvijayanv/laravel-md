### Directory Permissions

Laravel will need to write to the `bootstrap/cache` and `storage` directories, so you should ensure the web server process owner has permission to write to these directories.

### Production Server Optimization
```bash
php artisan optimize

# Remove optimization
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### The Health Route

By default, the health check route is served at /up and will return a 200 HTTP response if the application has booted without exceptions. Otherwise, a 500 HTTP response will be returned. You may configure the URI for this route in your application's bootstrap/app file:

```php
->withRouting(
    web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
    commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
    health: '/up',
    health: '/status',
)
```

When HTTP requests are made to this route, Laravel will also dispatch a Illuminate\Foundation\Events\DiagnosingHealth event, allowing you to perform additional health checks relevant to your application. Within a listener for this event, you may check your application's database or cache status. If you detect a problem with your application, you may simply throw an exception from the listener.
